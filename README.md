# Restaurant Data Analysis

## Project Overview:

This project focuses on analyzing restaurant data to uncover insights related to cuisines, ratings, price distribution, geographic trends, and more. By leveraging data analysis techniques and visualization tools, we aim to provide actionable insights into the restaurant industry.

## Dataset:

- Features: Restaurant names, locations, cuisines, price range, ratings, votes, reviews, online delivery availability, and more.

## Tasks & Analysis:

### 1.Top Cuisines

- Identify the top three most common cuisines.

- Calculate the percentage of restaurants serving each of the top cuisines.

### 2.City Analysis

- Find the city with the highest number of restaurants.

- Calculate the average restaurant rating for each city.

- Identify the city with the highest average rating.

### 3.Price Range Distribution

- Create a histogram or bar chart to visualize price range distribution.

- Calculate the percentage of restaurants in each price category.

### 4.Online Delivery

- Determine the percentage of restaurants offering online delivery.

- Compare the average ratings of restaurants with and without online delivery.

### 5.Restaurant Ratings

- Analyze the distribution of aggregate ratings.

- Identify the most common rating range.

- Calculate the average number of votes received by restaurants.

### 6.Cuisine Combination

- Identify the most common cuisine combinations.

- Determine if certain cuisine combinations have higher ratings.

### 7.Geographic Analysis
